Hello Grad Students!

To wrap up the semester, there is one last assignment per the Syllabus. 
Please go into the Grad Student Papers folder where you will find 
8 papers, 1 for each of you (and the Student Assignment table as an Excel file).

The assignment is simple:

Until Monday the 11th, last day before our final class for the semester,
 you have to read your assigned paper, and prepare a 5-minute Presentation. 
For the presentation digital content you should use something like Powerpoint 
(or whatever your favorite alternative is).

To make life easier on everyone, you are only expected to video-record your 
presentation at your convenience (just the slide in view and your voice is 
fine, no need for a speaker live-video) and upload it on Webcampus. 
A very convenient software to use is BandicamLinks to an external site., 
whose free version is limited to a 10min recording (and you only need 5mins), 
but you can use whatever other method you prefer. Remember it's a 5-minute 
presentation that should summarize and convey the highlights of the paper you 
have been assigned.
